# EE206A_Tesla_Project

Our deliverable is to simulate the blindspot scenario in the real world using three turtlebots, as described in the introduction. The leading vehicle should be able to detect the crossing pedestrian and publish warnings to the following vehicle. By doing so, it establishes V2V communication and avoids pedestrian crashes. From the pedestrian's perspective, safety concerns are eradicated. Meanwhile, from the perspective of the driver in the following vehicle, a comfortable driving experience is guaranteed because the warning signal allows the driver to slow down vehicles gradually as opposed to hitting the brake brutally.
